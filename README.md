The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted daily life, affecting diet, sleep quality, and physical exercise frequency. This study aimed to evaluate exercise frequency in relation to varying levels of mental distress in men and women. Regression analyses were conducted to model the relationship between different stages of COVID-19, physical exercise frequency, and mental distress levels. Margin analysis generated predictive models to potentially tailor exercise frequencies for men and women, aiming to reduce mental distress risks during future pandemics. The study found that mental distress during lockdown and post-restriction periods was linked to different exercise frequencies, with notable differences between genders. These insights could help optimize mental health during various pandemic stages by customizing exercise routines based on gender and the time of the week.
